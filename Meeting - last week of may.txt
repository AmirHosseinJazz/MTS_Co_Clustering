Points to Discuss -
    ++      TimeVAE is done - Check for metrics and quality
    ++      Breaking up data into smaller chunks tested 
    ++      Feature engineering on categorical 
    ++      Versions of TimeGAN and TimeVAE without Craving Variables 
    
    
    Quantutative measures =  Discriminative (TimeGAN Paper) 2 Layer LSTM -> Sigmoid
                             predictive Measure (TimeGan Paper) 2 Layer LSTM 
    Fix TSNE => Done



Next to do [embeddings acceptable now]-
    Community detection on Graph built by a distance measure 
    CCTN
    Complex Networks
    



--TODO:
    inference.py -> Encoding part , data should be according to each model's input
    Fix wandb logs for time gan7

        Q: From clusteroing on individuals to co-clustering?
        : For LSTM Classifier - > use a version with chunks of input (instead of the whole)
        Community -> add distance (DTW)
        Time VAE PAper => Q: how we construct the latent dimension in the multivariate case ? (180,latent_dim,24) dimension of the mean and variance
                        - Discuss next meeting architecture

        H1:
            Each node represents one variable from one person => each person will be described by 24 nodes
            Cluster first on variables = then person

        H2:
            if the latent dim (x1,x2) => then we do the clustering first on x2 then on the people

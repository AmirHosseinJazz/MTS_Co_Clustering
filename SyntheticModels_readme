-- Model : TimeGAN - 6
    : testing how it works with less features and same samples - it seems it works good with less features (namely 8)
    


-- Model : TimeGAN - 7
    : higher number of epochs- learning rate set to 0.005 - 120 timesteps

-- Model : TG-8
    :same as 7 with 60 timestep data


-- Model :TG- 9
    :new train params- only 8 feature - breaking data



-- model :TG-10 
    : seeing improvements in latest model -> test on break size -> 30
    : still on 8 feature
    : lr back to 0.001

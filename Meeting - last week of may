    Quantutative measures => Discriminative (TimeGAN Paper) 2 Layer LSTM -> Sigmoid
                             predictive Measure (TimeGan Paper) 2 Layer LSTM
    Fix TSNE



Next to do [embeddings acceptable now]-
    Community detection on Graph built by a distance measure 
    CCTN
    Complex Networks
    



--TODO:
    inference.py -> Encoding part , data should be according to each model's input
    Fix wandb logs for time gan7

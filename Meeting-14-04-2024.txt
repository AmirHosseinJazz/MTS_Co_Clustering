        -> No implementation

    -> downstream  prediction task 
        train on generated and report error on real
        train on real report error on generated
        -> How to train for clustering result?

My Questions:
    -> Can I break up the timeseries into smaller segments (120 to 6*20)

    -> Is the repo for the downstream predictive measure from Mado's paper available?
    
    -> Should I report both 12 and 29 vars?
    
    -> Any other measure beside silhouete and modularity?
    


T-SNE
    -> Individually
    -> using paddings to include all of timesteps instead of omitting 120:
    -> ACF Individually? (Similarity) [Explanation]
    -> cravings are categoriacl or binary?
    -> add a qualitative measure for syntethic vs real [ each person vs all the generated (take the average)] - BOX plot
    -> checking the dimensions of the output of the encoder after breaking up to smaller
-> if it is necessary ( removing features are possible! Craving )
-> KLDivergence as a qualitative measure (!Proirity)
-> TSNE -> possible indivual sample - how it works exactly (fit transform for both - check?)

-> Measure on the individual and feature lvl too (Mean, Covariance , KLDivergence or any other quantitative measure)
-> Normalize the features - from 0 to 1 (higher speed?) [per person not overall] - Fix the losses on TIMEGAN
